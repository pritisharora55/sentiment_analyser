# sentiment_analyser

This repository conatians an implementation for a text classification system for sentiment analysis. The classifier has been/can be trained on data provided in the form of positive and negative reviews. The developed system takes reviews as test data and categorizes them as positive or negative.

**objectives completed:**

- Fully implement probabilistic sentiment classifiers from scratch (Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression without using nltk)
- Deal with live data, including addressing issues of text normalization and feature engineering
- Refine and update your classifier for better performance
- Achieve an f1 score of ~ 95%
